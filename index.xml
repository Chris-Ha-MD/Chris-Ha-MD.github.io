      <description>-&amp;gt; from paper to code &amp;lt;-
A Brief History of ResNet I love ResNets. I just do. I canâ€™t stop thinking about them. They are simple yet effective. It inspired so many models that came after while still holding its own. Many ResNets or variations of it serve as the backbone of important image detection pipelines. Although they are already 5 years old at the time of writing, I do not see them going away anytime soon.</description>
